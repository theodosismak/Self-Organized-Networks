Abstract

The target of the thesis is the  optimal coverage of the  users as well as  the optimal  assignment
of resource  blocks in a Heterogeneous  Network. In our study, green  aspects  are also  taken into
consideration. Specifically, small  cells are deployed in an  area that is also  covered by a macro
base  station. The target of the problem  is to estimate the optimal   assignment of users to cells
and  resource  blocks to users, as well  as the optimal power allocation to the small cells in order
to maximize  the users' throughput and  minimize the suffered interference  and the network's energy
consumption. The problem is formulated  as a binary integer optimization one and  is solved with the
exploitation of Genetic Algorithm. We try to maximize the value of the objective function satisfying
an amount of constraints.

Key words: Heterogeneous Networks, energy efficiency, objective function, genetic algorithm.
